# 2D-microstructure by nucleation and growth method
Generation of 2D synthetic microstructure using MATLAB
This code is MATLAB based code written to generate synthetic microstructure in 2D.
The inputs required are:

  1.Grid size(a square grid of N x N), input --> N   ,
  
  2.No of grains (Warning!! Must be lesser than N)    ,
  
  3.Growth velocity in X and Y direction , 
  
  4.Frequency of growth   ,
  
 At the end of simulation the code gives the number of pixels inside the gains, at the grain boundary and at the triple points.
 
 A Results.pdf has also been provided to show the possible outputs from the code , along with a bar plot for fraction of different types of pixels
